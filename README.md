# Rclonte-Hyperspectral-LiDAR-Waveform-Decomposition
This code is about a novel method called Ranking Central Locations of Natural Target Echoes (Rclonte) for decomposing full-waveform hyperspectral LiDAR data.
Despite the plethora of various decomposition method studies about the traditional single-wavelength LiDAR systems, the exploration of hyperspectral waveform decomposition methods for novel HSL setup is inadequate and necessary. In this study (Submitted to Remote Sensing of Environment), we propose a novel method called Ranking Central Locations of Natural Target Echoes (Rclonte) for decomposing full-waveform hyperspectral LiDAR data. Code would be available recently or would be available once the maunscript was undergoing the minor revision stage.
