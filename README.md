# Rclonte-Hyperspectral-LiDAR-Waveform-Decomposition
This code is about a novel method called averaging (A) after ranking central locations of natural target echoes (Rclonte) (Rclonte-A) for full-waveform hyperspectral LiDAR data decomposition.
Code would be available once the maunscript was undergoing the minor revision stage.
